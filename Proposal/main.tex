\section{Current Situation, Needs, Ideas and Concept}
Managers need project management programs to manage their employees tasks and projects and give them a way for them to know what they need to do. Most of these programs have become bloated over time and have overcomplicated tasks that should be pretty straightforward causing the need for managers to take training to be able to use these tools. The project would involved in creating a project management program that cuts the bloat and focuses on making an intuitive and easy to use platform where no training is needed to properly use. This would involve a structure where:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Platform for managers: Managers can access a platform to view tasks and projects and delegate them to employees.
\item Platform for employees: Employees can view tasks assigned to them and add notes alerting the manager of questions and or detailed info about the task.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Scope, Span and Synopsis}
The problem is to understand project management in general: deadlines, task lists, schedules, file sharing, communication, teamwork, and logistics of project management. This is used to build a theory of management systems: leadership, planning, project monitoring, status, standards and, improvement.

The project is to develop and research a Program Management Software. This project is expected to cover:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item project monitoring: team performance, task duration
    \item team collaboration
    \item task management: prioritize, strategic planning,  scheduling
    \item reporting
\end{enumerate}
